## What's this?
An old game I wanted to develop but due to lacks of juice and the fact that the gameplay was really boring I decided to scrap it. This code is intended to be here as just for pure preservation as the code is a total mess and I TOTALLY NOT recommend to use it as a base code for your game or anything you could do.

## Do you mind re-doing the game?
No, absolutely. But not right now as I'm busy with other one and I'll require some thinking time to achieve a good and fun gameplay to even re-make this game, so yeah, maybe later.

## Which software does this use?
It uses Godot Engine 3.2, but with any Godot Engine 3 version would be good.

## Why so many Newgrounds references?
FNF has harmed me more than it has improved my life, I believe so.

## Where's Pumpkin's Deal original version?
Not lost, luckily. But I don't plan to re-release it in it's current state (Also, I'm lazy to turn on my old laptop to upload it to GitHub).
